      "message": "There is no license file in the upstream repo, tipically named LICENSE or COPYING. May you add one before we go on with adding the package?\n\nSome other questions:\n\n- What RDO version you want to get the package in? only master or also zed or other stable ones?\n- I see this role depends in collectd_config and tripleo_collectd ones. I see the first one is in RDO but not the second. Should it be added too? is there any rpm available in other repo?.\n- You plan to create stable branches for this repo or be branchless and support several openstack releases from master?\n\n",
