Introduction to rdoinfo
=======================

`rdoinfo` is a git repository containing information about current
`RDO <https://www.rdoproject.org>`_ releases, packages, maintainers and more.
Currently main YAML files, `rdo.yml`, `deps.yaml`, `tags.yaml`,
`buildsys-tags.yaml` contains:

* *rdo.yml* contains information of RDO releases, OpenStack packages included in RDO Trunk
            repositories and package configurations used by these packages.

* *deps.yml* contains metadata for general purpose dependencies which are external requirements
             for OpenStack services and don't exist in CentOS core repositories. These packages are included
             in RDO CloudSIG repos.

* *buildsys-tags.yaml* are used to specify the tagged builds in RDO CloudSIG repos for each
                       tag in CentOS Build System (CBS). It contains a set of mappings where the key is the
                       CBS tag name and the value is the package NVR included in the tag.

* *tags.yaml* attribute is used by the RDO Trunk builders to determine which releases we need
              to build a package for, and if we need to use some release-specific information for
              a project.

NOTE:
`buildsys-tags.yaml` and `tags.yaml` are just importing metadata from other
files which contains buildsys-tags and tags info for packages.


`rdoinfo` repository have two main directories:

* *buildsys-tags* are used to specify the tagged builds in RDO CloudSIG repos for each
  tag in CentOS Build System (CBS). In this dir, all files have specific convention:
  cloud `centOS release number` -openstack- `release` - `phase` where:

    * *centOS release number* - since Train release, it will be 7 or 8
    * *release*, official Openstack release name as ussuri, train, stein, etc.
      Available Openstack release names you can find here [1]_.
    * *phase* - name of fallowing phase:
        * *candidate* phase is assigned to packages to be rebuilt in CBS but not pushed
          to any RDO repository.
        * *el7-build* (only available for Rocky and newer releases) and
          *el8-build* (only available for Ussuri and newer releases) is assigned to packages
          that only required to build other packages but are not a runtime requirement
          for any other package.
        * *testing*  means that the package is used in deployments using RDO Trunk repo
          and published in a testing repo, but not official CloudSIG repository.
        * *release* is used for packages built and on the end for sending them to
                    the Cloud SIG repo.


In addition to the release names, we can use some special tag:

    * *version-locked* is used to prevent our periodic jobs from proposing updates to
      the source-branch tag in projects managed by the upper-constraints file.
    * *under-review* is used for packages that should be built by DLRN, but not
                     included in DLRN trunk repos.

Example what metadata is set in buildsys-tags/* files will be explained below.


* *tags* in this directory, all files contains metadata for under-development OpenStack release.
         Each file have one of the following convention:

    * *release* is the name of Openstack release
    * *release-uc* all projects with in the files, pins to the source-branch of all projects
                   included in Openstack upper-constraints to the versions in that file.
                   In other words, `-uc` tag is for the current development release with
                   all dependencies that are set to version defined in upper-constraints file.

Example what metadata is set in tags/* yaml files will be explained below.


`rdoinfo` python module provided in this repo is needed for parsing and
validating the info file.

Each file has its use. Below are examples of metadata per yaml file.

.. code::YAML
    packages:
    - project: ansible-role-chrony
      tags:
        train:
    ...

 Following attribues are assinged for e.g.: train.yaml file:

* *project:* package project name
* *tags:* Openstack release name


Why it has such architecture
============================

`DLRN can build packages using different upstream branches, not only master.
For example, we have DLRN workers building packages for the Train and Stein
releases. That allows us to test each commit landing to stable/train and
stable/stein before it is part of a release.` [4]_
Before packaging, all described yaml files are merged into one using `rdo-full.yml` file,
so after that DLRN is able to get all required informations (more info in `verify.py` file).


Projects that use `rdoinfo`:

    * rdopkg [5]_
    * DLRN [6]_
    * distroinfo [11]_


Updating rdoinfo
================

rdoinfo is managed using [RDO SoftwareFactory instance] [7]_.
In order to modify it you need to [login using your github account] [8]_. Once your account is created:

1. Clone the rdoinfo repository:

    .. code::bash

        git clone https://review.rdoproject.org/r/rdoinfo

2. Edit the `rdo.yml` or `deps.yml` files with the required changes.
3. Run `tox -e validate` command for basic sanity check.
4. Use `git review` to propose a change.


Usage
=====

`rdoinfo` is a dynamic information source so you probably want some mechanism
to sync latest from github and import the `rdoinfo` parser module in order to
have up-to-date RDO information.

See `rdoinfo/__init__.py:parse_info_file` function or `verify.py` script to
get an idea what's going on.

All `rdoinfo` tools are using another tool: `distroinfo` which is a pythom module
for parsing, validating and querying distribution/packaging metadata stored in
human readable and reviewable text/YAML files [11]_.
Earlier, RDO project was using a tool called `rdopkg` [5]_.
More informations how to use `distroinfo` module, you can find here [12]_.
