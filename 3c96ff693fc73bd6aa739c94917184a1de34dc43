So would need the build first, that can be done by updating Version: in distgit, like for xena at https://github.com/rdo-packages/ansible-role-chrony-distgit/commit/faf3f08948dbdfa3d46d5c9f04804ce98099e5d3\n\nI see all releases are following master so latest ansible-role-chrony patches should already be used in those releases for trunk repos, are u seeing some issue somewhere? just a guess may be you seeing issue in old stable releases which do not fallback_to_master? if that\u0027s true then can set source-branch: master or 1.1.0 whatever is desired\n\nCan u share some more context, i can then check further.\n\ntags:\n  stein: null\n  train: null\n  ussuri: null\n  victoria: null\n  wallaby: null\n  xena:\n    source-branch: 1.0.3\n  yoga: null\n  yoga-uc: null",
