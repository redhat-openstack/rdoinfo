The spec files also haven\u0027t changed in quite some time, making me think it is the build input into the job overall, as it is variable driven from what I can see, but someone who knows the build pipeline likely needs to take a look. Regardless, this change doesn\u0027t seem valid. The plugin is branchless... but xena release plugin for Train is kind of beyond what would have been tested for upstream even too.",
